# TODO:

# Part 3: Make Routes For Users
# Make routes for the following:

# GET /
# Redirect to /register.

# GET /register
# Show a form that when submitted will register/create a user. This form should accept a username, password, email, first_name, and last_name.
# Make sure you are using WTForms and that your password input hides the characters that the user is typing!

# POST /register
# Process the registration form by adding a new user. Then redirect to /secret

# GET /login
# Show a form that when submitted will login a user. This form should accept a username and a password.
# Make sure you are using WTForms and that your password input hides the characters that the user is typing!

# POST /login
# Process the login form, ensuring the user is authenticated and going to /secret if so.

# GET /secret
# Return the text “You made it!” (don’t worry, we’ll get rid of this soon)
